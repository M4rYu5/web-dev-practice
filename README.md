## [üìÅ store_front_react](./store_front_react)
- [‚òÅ _Website_](https://m4ryu5.github.io/web-dev-practice/store_front_react)
- A minimalist e-commerce front-end website featuring mock products from [dummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/), a responsive shopping cart backed by localStorage, and support for both light and dark theme preferences. The main purpose for building this website was to test my [___React___](https://react.dev/learn) knowledge, but in this process, I also learned about:
  - [___Tailwind___](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation): Really good alternative to CSS. (Note: Even though the lines were getting longer, I didn‚Äôt find it annoying).
  - [___DaisyUI___](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/): A component library for _Tailwind_; good for rapid development and theming of the site.
  - ___JSX___ used by [___React___](https://react.dev/learn) to build components.
  - ___TypeScript___.
